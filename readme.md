WELCOME TO THE MUTHAFUCKIN REPO
If you know how python works then this should be pretty easy to test the code, if not good luck
Feel free to check the "VersionAlpha" folder this contains everything that was in the original test versions of the calculator
The simulator folder has my more refinded system for the elo calculator so you can simulate a ton of races in there if youd like.
Extra and planning arent really that important but feel free to look if you are curious as to how I built some of the chings in here 

If you go to the streamlit folder and download streamlit (pip install streamlit) and then execute any of the four .py files that are in the streamlit folder (python -m streamlit run streamlit\logracev3.py), you can see what the planned UI was going to look like, but that is defintly not set in stone and for all I know might completely change in the future. 

If you are curious about how the SQL databases may be laid out check out the databasetesting in the streamlit folder. You can use (https://sqlitebrowser.org/) to view the database.

BUT THE MAIN THING RIGHT NOW IS THE SIM, FUCK AROUND WITH THE NUMBERS AND TELL ME WHAT YOU FIND FIT! - You can change any of the settings around the top of the code, and any of the player skill ratings if youd like, or if your so inclined you can try changing the straight up code around too.

good luck jesowen

Use visual studio code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to view and test the simulator, MAKE SURE THE PYTHON extension is installed.
