Welcome to the Master Beerio Manager Repo

Only thing you are going to want to look at right now is the "IAMTHEIMPORTANTFOLDER" Folder because that is where the actual working code is but feel free to dig around to try and understand what is going on.

There is also a very very basic beeriodb file where you can test adding some old Beerio data into the database - this is far from complete though
