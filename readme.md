This is the master beerio manager! welcome

work on databse first
then figure out elo logic

If you are here I probably know you, so for the moment only check out the elocalcualtors folder and try to run the py commands

elo.py wasnt consistent with its math but the newelocalculator should have fixed that (hopefully)

Old Elo: Pool was not super consistent and more elo might have been awarded than taken (Awarded: 50 elo --- Taken: -20 Elo)
New Elo: Pool is more consistent than before only allowing small discrepencies in the data (Awarded 50 elo --- Taken: -50 Elo)
